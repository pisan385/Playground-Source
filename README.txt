This is a copy of the Unity Playground

on MacOS 10.12.6

using Using Unity LTS 2018.4.20f1

I created an empty project and then imported
Unity Playground from the Unity Asset Store

on 3 April 2020

The Unity Editor had to restart twice as the Playground files were
being imported.

All the playground demos work in Unity editor.
